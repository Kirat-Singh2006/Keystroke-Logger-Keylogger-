Keystroke Logger (Educational Keylogging Demonstration)

Overview
This project is an educational cybersecurity demonstration that shows how keystroke logging can be implemented using the pynput library. It captures keyboard input at the OS level and records it to a file for analysis.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to help security students and engineers:
	•	understand how keylogging malware operates internally
	•	recognize the risks associated with input interception
	•	improve detection and prevention strategies on monitored systems

Technical Details
	•	Language: Python
	•	Library: pynput
	•	Functionality: Captures keyboard events and logs them locally

Defensive Perspective
From a defensive standpoint, this project highlights:
	•	how user input can be intercepted by malicious software
	•	the importance of endpoint monitoring and behavioral detection
	•	why application whitelisting and OS-level protections are critical

Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for educational, research, and authorized testing purposes in controlled environments.
Unauthorized use of keylogging software is illegal and unethical.
